# 📝 Image Retrieval for Arabic Handwritten Characters

This project implements an **image similarity search system** designed to retrieve the **top 5 most similar Arabic handwritten characters** from a dataset. The system applies **image processing techniques** and **similarity measures** to improve retrieval accuracy.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Retrieve similar Arabic handwritten characters from a dataset.
- **Techniques:** 
    - Image Preprocessing (Resizing, Grayscale Conversion, Normalization)
    - Feature Extraction
    - Similarity Calculation (e.g., Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the dataset folder (`dataset/`) with Arabic handwritten character images.
3. Open `Image Retrieval for Arabic Handwritten Characters.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to preprocess the images, extract features, and test the retrieval system.
